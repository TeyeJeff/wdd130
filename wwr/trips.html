            <h2>WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY...</h2>
            <p><strong>‚ÄúGreat trip for our high school seniors. Fun, mellow, relaxing, and time for them to be kids and enjoy being on the water!‚Äù</strong></p>
            <h4>Aikins, Lovis</h4>
            <p><strong>"Another rafting place cancelled on me last minute. I called Spud Rivers Explorers the day prior and they fit me as well as 3 other guests for my best friend's birthday‚Äîno problem. The river was down because of being late in the season, but the young staff is so knowledgeable and energetic we still had a fantastic time. It's a real delight to be around people that like what they do. I will definitely book them again."</strong></p>
            <h4>Dzade, Emmanuel</h4>
            <p><strong>"This was the best crew I've ever rafted with. They were all focused on safety and fun and not acting all cool and poised. If you are on the fence jump - this company is worth it."</strong></p>
            <h4>Amegatse, Bright</h4>
            <p><strong>"I've been with numerous companies on numerous rivers across the world. I find myself going back to Spud Rivers Explorers again and again for a few simple reasons. The guides are pleasant and capable, the rivers they float are dynamic and accessible to most people, and they just like to have a lot of good safe fun."</strong></p>
